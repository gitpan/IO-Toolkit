NAME
    IO::Toolkit

ABSTRACT
    IO::Toolkit - Perl extension to create logfiles

PREREQUISITS
    This module needs Crypt::RC6 for its encryption/decryption routine.
    Digest::MD5 and DirHandle used for checksum routines.

SYNOPSIS
    Sample Script:

       ... soon ...
   
    This displays and creates a logfile like this:

       ... soon ...

DESCRIPTION
    Provides a human-readable logfile and is ment to replace "print" and
    "die" in your programs.

    This module was written to provide an easy way to log messages. It
    checks for an option --loglevel=EMCDQ- where each character stands for a
    certain level. e.g.

       E   = Error
       S   = System
       M   = Message
       D   = Debug
       -   = Silent
       all = All messages

    You can use all characters you would like to use. These are just
    examples.

    the minus ("-") has a special meaning: supresses output to the screen
    and ONLY logs them to the file. Please see the sample script for more
    details.

    The function gettimestamp returns the current time in the format used
    for the logfile. If you specifiy the format &gettimestamp("filename") it
    returns something like this: 20041009131500

  IO::Toolkit::logme("M","Message")
    The first parameter specifies the severity of the message. The message
    is only logged, if $getopt_loglevel contains that severity.

    Because IO::Toolkit::logme is exported, you can just use
    logme("M","message") in your scripts.

  IO::Toolkit::moduleinfo
    prints a list of loaded modules.

  IO::Toolkit::trim
    trims a variable.

  IO::Toolkit::hash2sql
    creates SQL code to insert a hash into a table.

    Example:

       use IO::Toolkit;

       my %hash=(
          firstname=>"Markus",
          lastname=>"Linke",
       );

       print IO::Toolkit::hash2sqlinsert("tablename",%hash)."\n";
   
    Result:

       insert into tablename (firstname,lastname) values ("Markus","Linke") 

    IO::Toolkit::sql2data executes SQL statement and creates a array of
    hashs

       use IO::Toolkit;
       use Data::Dumper;
       print Dumper(IO::Toolkit::sql2data($dbh,"select * from environments"));

  IO::Toolkit::encrypt and IO::Toolkit::decrypt
    needs two strings as parameters (e.g. seed and password) and returns an
    encrypted/decrypted value.

  IO::Toolkit::pid("exclusive|overwrite|remove","/tmp/filename.pid");
    Create or delete PID file. If set to exclusive, the program dies if the
    file already exists.

  my $md5 = IO::Toolkit::get_md5_checksum("Toolkit.pm");
    Create a MD5 checksum for the filename provided.

EXPORT
    logme and gettimestamp are exported.
